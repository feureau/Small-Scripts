# Bricker â€“ Photoreal LEGO/Minecraft Simulations

Bricker is a powerful modeling, animation, and simulation addon for Blender designed to streamline and, in many cases, automate the artist's workflow for LEGO bricks. Created by Christopher Gearhart.

Bricker may be useful for stop motion animators wishing to add brick simulations (fire, water, smoke, etc.) or set extensions to their work. It may also be useful for LEGO sculptors and model builders as a modeling and pre-visualization tool (Bricker features an LDR exporter for generating build instructions in other applications).
