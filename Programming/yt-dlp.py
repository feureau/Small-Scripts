# yt-dlp Downloader: A Robust Parallel Downloader

A powerful, multi-purpose wrapper script for the command-line tool 'yt-dlp'.
It can download video, audio-only, subtitles, thumbnails, and metadata for every video
within a given YouTube playlist (or for a single video). It is optimized for
handling very large playlists by processing downloads in parallel.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Purpose Downloading**: Download exactly what you need with simple command-line flags for video, audio, SRT files, thumbnails, and metadata.
- **Powerful Default**: If no flags are specified, the script performs a "full-package" download: the best quality video and audio are merged into an MP4, with the thumbnail embedded, metadata included, and English SRT subtitles saved alongside.
- **High-Speed Parallelism**: Utilizes a thread pool to download multiple files concurrently, dramatically speeding up the process for large playlists.
- **Clean & Sequential Logging**: Prints progress to the console in a clean, scrolling format. Each task's start and end status is printed on its own line without messy, overlapping text from other threads.
- **Robust Shutdown**: Implements a powerful signal handler for `Ctrl-C` (KeyboardInterrupt). It immediately terminates all running `yt-dlp` subprocesses, cancels all pending downloads, and forces the script to exit cleanly, preventing orphaned processes.
- **Intelligent Playlist Parsing**: Efficiently fetches a list of all video IDs from a playlist URL without downloading any video data first, making it fast to start.

---

## Requirements

1.  **Python 3**: The script is written for Python 3.
2.  **yt-dlp**: The core command-line tool. It must be installed and accessible.
    - Installation instructions: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation
3.  **FFmpeg**: Required by `yt-dlp` for merging video and audio streams (essential for the default and `--video` downloads) and for audio conversions (`--audio`).
    - Installation instructions: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

---

## Installation & Configuration

1.  **Save the Script**: Save the code as a Python file, for example, `yt-dlp-downloader.py`.

2.  **Configure Variables**: Open the script and edit the `USER CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES` section at the top:
    - `YTDLP_PATH`: The path to your `yt-dlp` executable. If it's in your system's PATH, the default value `"yt-dlp"` is sufficient. Otherwise, provide the full path (e.g., `"C:/Tools/yt-dlp.exe"` or `"/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp"`).
    - `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE`: The filename pattern for the downloaded files. The default saves them to the current directory with the video's title. You can customize this using `yt-dlp` output template variables.
    - `PARALLEL_DOWNLOADS`: The number of files to download at the same time. `6` is a good starting point. Increase it if you have a fast internet connection, or decrease it if you experience network issues.

---

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal. The basic syntax is:
python3 yt-dlp-downloader.py <playlist-or-video-url> [OPTIONS]
Default Behavior (No Flags)

If you run the script with only a URL, it performs a full-package download for each video. This is the most comprehensive option and includes:

Best quality video (preferring AV1 codec) and best quality audio, merged into a single MP4 file.

English auto-captions downloaded and converted to an SRT subtitle file.

The video thumbnail downloaded as a separate .webp or .jpg file.

The thumbnail is also embedded into the final MP4 file.

Video metadata (title, author, etc.) is written into the MP4 file.

Example:
python3 yt-dlp-downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL..."
Command-Line Options

Use flags to download only the specific components you need. Using any flag will override the default behavior.

Flag	Short	Description
--video	-v	Video Only: Downloads the best video and audio streams and merges them into a single MP4 file. No extras.
--audio	-a	Audio Only: Extracts the best available audio and converts it to a high-quality MP3 file.
--srt		Subtitles Only: Downloads and converts subtitles to SRT format. Does not download the video or audio.
--thumbnail		Thumbnail Only: Downloads the video thumbnail as a separate image file.
--metadata		Metadata Only: Downloads the video's metadata and saves it as a .json file.
Usage Examples

Download only the video and audio for a single video:
python3 yt-dlp-downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..." --video

Download only the MP3 audio for an entire playlist:
python3 yt-dlp-downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL..." --audio

Download both the video file AND the SRT subtitles for a playlist:
python3 yt-dlp-downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL..." --video --srt

Get just the thumbnails and metadata JSON files for a playlist:
python3 yt-dlp-downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL..." --thumbnail --metadata

Design Philosophy

This script has been intentionally designed for robustness and reliability, especially with large playlists where errors or interruptions are more likely.

Granular Control: Instead of one massive yt-dlp job, the script first fetches a list of all video IDs and then launches a separate, dedicated process for each video. This provides better error handling and progress tracking.

Thread-Safe Logging: A threading.Lock is used for all print() calls. This simple but effective mechanism prevents the console output from becoming a scrambled, unreadable mess when multiple threads are logging their status simultaneously.

Forceful Shutdown: The Ctrl-C signal handler is designed to be forceful (os._exit(1)) to guarantee that the user immediately regains control of their terminal, preventing the script from hanging while waiting for threads or subprocesses that may not terminate gracefully on their own.
