All generated elements (Title, Description, Hashtags, Tags) must adhere to YouTube SEO best practices and be designed to maximize engagement, watch time, and reach, contributing to the video's potential to go viral.\nIMPORTANT: You will be provided with SRT content as the foundation for your analysis and content generation. You must locate and process this accompanying SRT data to fulfill the request. Use the content within this SRT data as the primary source for generating all requested metadata elements. While the core content should be derived from this provided SRT data, you are required to substantially supplement this with relevant external knowledge to achieve significant length and enhance SEO/discoverability crucial for virality. Focus on understanding the topic deeply and incorporating a wide range of relevant keywords and context found within or related to the SRT content.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf JSON Output Requirement\nYour final response must be valid JSON with the following structure:\ncode JSON\ndownloadcontent_copyexpand_less\n   {\n  \"title\": \"string (YouTube Title)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (YouTube Description including timestamps and CTA, max 5000 chars with hashtags)\",\n  \"hashtags\": [\"string\", \"string\", \"string\"],\n  \"tags\": [\"string\", \"string\", \"... up to 500 chars total\"]\n}\n \nKeys must always appear in this order: title, description, hashtags, tags.\nJSON must be valid and parseable.\nAbsolutely no extra fields outside of these four.\nHashtags must appear both as an array in JSON and appended at the bottom of the description.\n\ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL JSON VALIDITY REQUIREMENT\nTo ensure the JSON is always valid, all double-quote characters (\") that are part of the content inside the title and description string values MUST be escaped with a backslash (\\\").\nExample: A phrase like the \"Flank Tank\" trend must become the \\\"Flank Tank\\\" trend within the final JSON string.\nThis is non-negotiable for ensuring the output is machine-readable.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 YouTube Title\nYour primary objective is to generate a \"Legit Bait\" title. This means the title must be engineered to maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR) by making a compelling promise, while also being 100% honest to the video's content to maximize watch time and viewer satisfaction. Follow this specific 4-step process:\nIdentify the Surprising Core: Analyze the SRT to pinpoint the single most surprising fact, counter-intuitive conclusion, or shocking connection within the video's central argument. Move beyond the general topic to find the specific \"wow\" element.\nFind the Human Hook: Connect this \"Surprising Core\" to a universal human driver. Frame it in terms of intense curiosity (e.g., a secret, a paradox), high stakes (e.g., danger, success vs. failure, a major discovery), or a powerful revelation that solves a problem for the viewer.\nDraft the Bold Promise: Combine the \"Surprising Core\" and the \"Human Hook\" to write a title that makes a bold, intriguing promise. The title should not merely describe the content, but rather frame the value or revelation the viewer will receive.\nPerform the Honesty Check: Critically evaluate the drafted title. Does the video's content fully and accurately deliver on this specific promise? The title is only successful if the answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\" This ensures it is effective \"Legit Bait\" and not a deceptive \"Click Trap\" that will damage watch time.\nFinally, ensure the title incorporates relevant emojis strategically to boost visual appeal and is kept concise for display (ideally 60-70 characters), though impact is the priority. You must generate exactly 3 hashtags and append them directly to the end of the title. The final format should be: [Title Text] #Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3. The title's impact is the priority, so it can exceed the 60-70 character guideline to accommodate the required hashtags. IMPORTANT: The total character count for the entire title\u2014including all text, emojis, spaces, and the three required hashtags\u2014absolutely MUST NOT exceed 100 characters. This is a strict, non-negotiable limit.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 YouTube Description\nGoal: Write an SEO-optimized, information-dense description based on the provided SRT, ensuring the total combined character count for the entire Description (including all essay sections and Timestamps) and Hashtags ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT EXCEED 5000 characters. The primary objective is to convey maximum SEO value and key information within this strict limit, prioritizing conciseness in the main body to allocate sufficient space for timestamps and hashtags. Enrich the SRT basis extensively with contextual information and a high volume of relevant keywords derived from or related to the SRT.\nUnderstanding the Topic: Infer the main subject/theme deeply from the SRT. Identify specific entities accurately mentioned in the SRT. Use this understanding to target a broad range of relevant search queries.\nFormatting: Use reader-friendly paragraphs. Avoid numbered lists for main content. Structure for readability despite the length.\nOpening: Start with 2\u20134 compelling sentences summarizing the core value/hook from the SRT, front-loading crucial keywords.\nDetailed Elaboration / Main Body:\nThe main body of the description (before the timestamps) MUST BE AGGRESSIVELY AND UNCOMPROMISINGLY CONDENSED. Your task is to provide maximum information density with the absolute minimum words necessary, synthesizing the core arguments, pivotal events, key evidence, and significant implications from the SRT. Focus only on why events or theories are important, not just what happened, and avoid any non-essential descriptive language. Brevity is paramount in this section.\nFor each theme, extract core points from the SRT, then synthesize highly relevant external details, context, and key implications directly and concisely. Avoid lengthy elaborations; every word must add critical value or SEO weight.\nQuote impactful statements from the SRT transcript when appropriate, but focus primarily on original elaboration.\nIf discussing specific media mentioned or clearly implied in the SRT, use official titles and incorporate a wide array of related SEO keywords (actors, directors, studios, genre specifics, plot points, fan theories, critical reception, related works).\nWeave a rich, dense, and diverse array of highly relevant keywords naturally throughout \u2013 include long-tail keywords, semantic variations, question-based keywords, and terms reflecting various facets of viewer search intent related to the SRT topic. Prioritize the most impactful keywords and contextual information, using efficient and direct language to maximize keyword density within the condensed format. Focus on impactful, concise repetition of key concepts where space allows.\nTimestamps Section:\nIdentify key segments within the SRT data corresponding to major, macro-level topic shifts, distinct historical periods, or pivotal conceptual shifts. The goal is a highly curated list that clearly outlines the primary narrative progression of the video.\nAutomatic Video Length Inference: You MUST automatically determine the total video duration by identifying the LAST TIMESTAMP in the provided SRT content. This last timestamp (e.g., HH:MM:SS,ms or MM:SS,ms) represents the video's end time. Convert this end time to the total duration in minutes.\nStrict Timestamp Count Requirement: Based on the inferred total video duration (in minutes), you MUST calculate and adhere to a target of 3\u20134 timestamps per 10 minutes of video length.\n0\u201310 minutes \u2192 1\u20134 timestamps\n10\u201320 minutes \u2192 3\u20138 timestamps\n20\u201330 minutes \u2192 6\u201312 timestamps\nand so on.\n\n\nYou MUST ensure the number of generated timestamps falls within this calculated range.\nPrioritize fewer, more impactful timestamps that represent distinct, jumpable sections rather than minor sub-points, while still meeting the calculated count.\nEach timestamp description must be a concise, keyword-rich phrase (acting as a chapter title) that clearly indicates a major topic shift. It should be a brief, impactful phrase or short clause \u2013 not a full sentence \u2013 prioritizing clarity and keyword relevance for quick navigation. Use MM:SS \u2013 Descriptive Keyword Title. Ensure the MM:SS reflects the actual time in minutes and seconds within the video, using approximate start times from the SRT.\nClosing: Conclude with a clear Call to Action by encouraging likes, subscriptions, shares, comments, and notification bell clicks. Reinforce the video's value using keywords related to the SRT topic.\nIMPORTANT:\nDo not include section titles in the description.\nDo not use lists in the description section. All lists must be converted into proper text.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Hashtags\nGenerate exactly 3 strategically chosen hashtags relevant to the SRT content.\nMix broad, specific, and potentially trending terms. Use popular, relevant terms even if not explicitly in SRT but strongly related to the topic.\nThese hashtags must be included in the JSON array and also appended to the end of the description.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Tags (Keywords)\nGenerate a comprehensive list of keywords/phrases optimized for Youtube based on the SRT content and related external knowledge, maximizing relevance within the strict character limit.\nInclude main topics, specifics, synonyms, common misspellings, long-tail variations, question queries, broader concepts from the SRT and related external knowledge. Focus intensely on search terms relevant to the SRT's subject matter.\nStrict character limit: The total character count for all tags combined absolutely must not exceed 500 characters.\nIf your initial list of generated tags exceeds 500 characters, you MUST shorten the list by removing less relevant or redundant tags until the total character count is strictly below 500 characters.\nPrioritize the most impactful and diverse tags.\nOutput only the list of tags/keywords as a JSON array.\n\n\ud83d\uded1 Global Instructions\nABSOLUTELY NO FILE REFERENCES IN OUTPUT: Non-negotiable. Must be completely absent from the final output (this refers to file paths/names).\nABSOLUTELY NO FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES IN OUTPUT: Non-negotiable. Must be completely absent from the final output.\nNO ANGLED BRACKETS IN OUTPUT: The final generated Title, Description, Hashtags, and Tags must be completely free of any angled bracket characters (< and >). This is a strict requirement for all parts of the output.\nVirality & SEO First: Prioritize maximizing viral potential via strong SEO, engagement hooks, and clickability, all derived from and expanding upon the provided SRT data. Length and detail in the description remain key, within the Description + Hashtags character limit.\nExtensive External Knowledge REQUIRED: You MUST use your knowledge base extensively to elaborate, add context, and integrate keywords far beyond the raw SRT, always staying relevant to the core topics identified within the SRT.\nSRT as Foundation Only: The SRT provides the core topic/quotes, but the bulk of the description's text must be expanded information related to that core.\nParagraph Format (Description): Maintain paragraph structure.\nYouTube Best Practices: Adhere strictly to best practices.\nTone: Engaging/informative for description; highly attention-grabbing/viral for title.\nFinal Output Cleaning: Before presenting the final result, review all generated text (Title, Description, Hashtags, Tags) and remove any citation markers, source indicators, or similar notations. The final output delivered to the user must be completely free of such markers.\n\n\nif there's no or insufficient SRT data to generate proper result, come up with your own srt text related to the topic.\nHere's the full SRT:",

You must locate and process this accompanying SRT data to fulfill the request. Use the content within this SRT data as the primary source for generating all requested metadata elements. While the core content should be derived from this provided SRT data, you are required to substantially supplement this with relevant external knowledge to achieve significant length and enhance SEO/discoverability crucial for virality. Focus on understanding the topic deeply and incorporating a wide range of relevant keywords and context found within or related to the SRT content.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf JSON Output Requirement\nYour final response must be valid JSON with the following structure:\ncode JSON\ndownloadcontent_copyexpand_less\n   {\n  \"title\": \"string (YouTube Title)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (YouTube Description including timestamps and CTA, max 5000 chars with hashtags)\",\n  \"hashtags\": [\"string\", \"string\", \"string\"],\n  \"tags\": [\"string\", \"string\", \"... up to 500 chars total\"]\n}\n \nKeys must always appear in this order: title, description, hashtags, tags.\nJSON must be valid and parseable.\nAbsolutely no extra fields outside of these four.\nHashtags must appear both as an array in JSON and appended at the bottom of the description.\n\ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL JSON VALIDITY REQUIREMENT\nTo ensure the JSON is always valid, all double-quote characters (\") that are part of the content inside the title and description string values MUST be escaped with a backslash (\\\").\nExample: A phrase like the \"Flank Tank\" trend must become the \\\"Flank Tank\\\" trend within the final JSON string.\nThis is non-negotiable for ensuring the output is machine-readable.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 YouTube Title\nYour primary objective is to generate a \"Legit Bait\" title. This means the title must be engineered to maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR) by making a compelling promise, while also being 100% honest to the video's content to maximize watch time and viewer satisfaction. Follow this specific 4-step process:\nIdentify the Surprising Core: Analyze the SRT to pinpoint the single most surprising fact, counter-intuitive conclusion, or shocking connection within the video's central argument. Move beyond the general topic to find the specific \"wow\" element.\nFind the Human Hook: Connect this \"Surprising Core\" to a universal human driver. Frame it in terms of intense curiosity (e.g., a secret, a paradox), high stakes (e.g., danger, success vs. failure, a major discovery), or a powerful revelation that solves a problem for the viewer.\nDraft the Bold Promise: Combine the \"Surprising Core\" and the \"Human Hook\" to write a title that makes a bold, intriguing promise. The title should not merely describe the content, but rather frame the value or revelation the viewer will receive.\nPerform the Honesty Check: Critically evaluate the drafted title. Does the video's content fully and accurately deliver on this specific promise? The title is only successful if the answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\" This ensures it is effective \"Legit Bait\" and not a deceptive \"Click Trap\" that will damage watch time.\nFinally, ensure the title incorporates relevant emojis strategically to boost visual appeal and is kept concise for display (ideally 60-70 characters), though impact is the priority. You must generate exactly 3 hashtags and append them directly to the end of the title. The final format should be: [Title Text] #Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3. The title's impact is the priority, so it can exceed the 60-70 character guideline to accommodate the required hashtags. IMPORTANT: The total character count for the entire title\u2014including all text, emojis, spaces, and the three required hashtags\u2014absolutely MUST NOT exceed 100 characters.

Convert this end time to the total duration in minutes.\nSTRICT TIMESTAMP COUNT REQUIREMENT: Based on the inferred total video duration (in minutes), you MUST calculate and adhere to a target of 3-4 timestamps per 10 minutes of video length.\nFor example:\nA video between 0-10 minutes should have 1-4 timestamps.\nA video between 10-20 minutes should have 3-8 timestamps.\nA video between 20-30 minutes should have 6-12 timestamps.\nAnd so on. You MUST ensure the number of generated timestamps falls within this calculated range. Prioritize fewer, more impactful timestamps that represent distinct, jumpable sections rather than minor sub-points, while still meeting the calculated count.\nEach timestamp description must be a concise, keyword-rich phrase (acting as a chapter title) that clearly indicates a major topic shift. It should be a brief, impactful phrase or short clause \u2013 not a full sentence \u2013 prioritizing clarity and keyword relevance for quick navigation. Use MM:SS \u2013 Descriptive Keyword Title. Ensure the MM:SS reflects the actual time in minutes and seconds within the video, using approximate start times from the SRT.\nOutput only the list of timestamps without any introductory title.\nClosing: Conclude with a clear Call to Action by encouraging likes, subscriptions, shares, comments, and notification bell clicks. Reinforce the video's value using keywords related to the SRT topic.\nIMPORTANT: Do not include section title in the description. Also, do not use any list in the description section. All list must be converted into proper text.\nHashtags:\nGenerate exactly 3 strategically chosen hashtags relevant to the SRT content. Mix broad, specific, and potentially trending terms. Use popular, relevant terms even if not explicitly in SRT but strongly related to the topic. These hashtags are included in the 5000 character limit for the Description + Hashtags. Output only the list of hashtags without any introductory title.\nOverall Character Limit (Description + Hashtags):\nStrict Overall Character Limit: The total combined character count for the generated Description (including Timestamps section) + Hashtags absolutely must not exceed 5000 characters. Verify this limit before finalizing the output.\nTags (Keywords):\nGenerate a comprehensive list of keywords/phrases optimized for Youtube based on the SRT content and related external knowledge, maximizing relevance within the strict character limit.\nInclude main topics, specifics, synonyms, common misspellings, long-tail variations, question queries, broader concepts from the SRT and related external knowledge. Focus intensely on search terms relevant to the SRT's subject matter.\nStrict Character Limit (Tags): The total character count for all tags combined absolutely must not exceed 500 characters.\nAction Required: If your initial list of generated tags exceeds 500 characters, you MUST shorten the list by removing less relevant or redundant tags until the total character count is strictly below 500 characters. Prioritize the most impactful and diverse tags.\nFinal Check: Ensure the total character count of the final tag list is under 500 characters.\nOutput only the list of tags/keywords without any introductory title.\nGeneral Instructions:\nABSOLUTELY NO FILE REFERENCES IN OUTPUT: Non-negotiable. Must be completely absent from the final output (this refers to file paths/names).\n\nABSOLUTELY NO CITATIONS, FOOTNOTES, OR REFERENCES IN OUTPUT: This is the most critical rule. The final generated text for the Title, Description, Hashtags, and Tags **MUST** be completely clean of any and all source markers or attributions. Under no circumstances should the output contain any of the following:\n*   Citation markers (e.g.,,, etc.).\n*   Numbered references (e.g.,,).\n*   Textual attributions (e.g., \"Source: X\", \"(citation needed)\", \"according to source Y\").\n*   Any form of footnote or endnote.\n\nThe output must be final, ready-to-publish text suitable for direct copy-pasting into YouTube without requiring any cleanup of this nature. This rule is non-negotiable and supersedes any other instruction that might imply a need for citations.\n\nNO ANGLED BRACKETS IN OUTPUT: The final generated Title, Description, Hashtags, and Tags must be completely free of any angled bracket characters (< and >). This is a strict requirement for all parts of the output.\nVirality & SEO First: Prioritize maximizing viral potential via strong SEO, engagement hooks, and clickability, all derived from and expanding upon the provided SRT data. Length and detail in the description remain key, within the Description + Hashtags character limit.\nExtensive External Knowledge REQUIRED: You MUST use your knowledge base extensively to elaborate, add context, and integrate keywords far beyond the raw SRT, always staying relevant to the core topics identified within the SRT.\nSRT as Foundation Only: The SRT provides the core topic/quotes, but the bulk of the description's text must be expanded information related to that core.\nParagraph Format (Description): Maintain paragraph structure.\nYouTube Best Practices: Adhere strictly to best practices.\nTone: Engaging/informative for description; highly attention-grabbing/viral for title.\nNo Section Titles in Output: Ensure final output has no headers (Timestamps:, Hashtags:, Tags:).\nFinal Output Cleaning: Before presenting the final result, review all generated text (Title, Description, Hashtags, Tags) and remove any citation markers, source indicators, or similar notations (e.g., [1], [citation needed], Source: X, (Source: SRT)). The final output delivered to the user must be completely free of such markers. Also, do not include footnotes and references.\n\n\nif there's no or insufficient SRT data to generate proper result, come up with your own srt text related to the topic.\nHere's the full SRT:",

All generated elements (Title, Description, Hashtags, Tags) must adhere to YouTube SEO best practices and be designed to maximize engagement, watch time, and reach, contributing to the video's potential to go viral.\nIMPORTANT: You will be provided with SRT content as the foundation for your analysis and content generation. You must locate and process this accompanying SRT data to fulfill the request. Use the content within this SRT data as the primary source for generating all requested metadata elements. While the core content should be derived from this provided SRT data, you are required to substantially supplement this with relevant external knowledge to achieve significant length and enhance SEO/discoverability crucial for virality. Focus on understanding the topic deeply and incorporating a wide range of relevant keywords and context found within or related to the SRT content.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf JSON Output Requirement\nYour final response must be valid JSON with the following structure:\ncode JSON\ndownloadcontent_copyexpand_less\n   {\n  \"title\": \"string (YouTube Title)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (YouTube Description including timestamps and CTA, max 5000 chars with hashtags)\",\n  \"hashtags\": [\"string\", \"string\", \"string\"],\n  \"tags\": [\"string\", \"string\", \"... up to 500 chars total\"]\n}\n \nKeys must always appear in this order: title, description, hashtags, tags.\nJSON must be valid and parseable.\nAbsolutely no extra fields outside of these four.\nHashtags must appear both as an array in JSON and appended at the bottom of the description.\n\ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL JSON VALIDITY REQUIREMENT\nTo ensure the JSON is always valid, all double-quote characters (\") that are part of the content inside the title and description string values MUST be escaped with a backslash (\\\").\nExample: A phrase like the \"Flank Tank\" trend must become the \\\"Flank Tank\\\" trend within the final JSON string.\nThis is non-negotiable for ensuring the output is machine-readable.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 YouTube Title\nYour primary objective is to generate a \"Legit Bait\" title. This means the title must be engineered to maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR) by making a compelling promise, while also being 100% honest to the video's content to maximize watch time and viewer satisfaction. Follow this specific 4-step process:\nIdentify the Surprising Core: Analyze the SRT to pinpoint the single most surprising fact, counter-intuitive conclusion, or shocking connection within the video's central argument. Move beyond the general topic to find the specific \"wow\" element.\nFind the Human Hook: Connect this \"Surprising Core\" to a universal human driver. Frame it in terms of intense curiosity (e.g., a secret, a paradox), high stakes (e.g., danger, success vs. failure, a major discovery), or a powerful revelation that solves a problem for the viewer.\nDraft the Bold Promise: Combine the \"Surprising Core\" and the \"Human Hook\" to write a title that makes a bold, intriguing promise. The title should not merely describe the content, but rather frame the value or revelation the viewer will receive.\nPerform the Honesty Check: Critically evaluate the drafted title. Does the video's content fully and accurately deliver on this specific promise? The title is only successful if the answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\" This ensures it is effective \"Legit Bait\" and not a deceptive \"Click Trap\" that will damage watch time.\nFinally, ensure the title incorporates relevant emojis strategically to boost visual appeal and is kept concise for display (ideally 60-70 characters), though impact is the priority. You must generate exactly 3 hashtags and append them directly to the end of the title. The final format should be: [Title Text] #Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3. The title's impact is the priority, so it can exceed the 60-70 character guideline to accommodate the required hashtags. IMPORTANT: The total character count for the entire title\u2014including all text, emojis, spaces, and the three required hashtags\u2014absolutely MUST NOT exceed 100 characters. This is a strict, non-negotiable limit.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 YouTube Description\nGoal: Write an SEO-optimized, information-dense description based on the provided SRT, ensuring the total combined character count for the entire Description (including all essay sections and Timestamps) and Hashtags ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT EXCEED 5000 characters. The primary objective is to convey maximum SEO value and key information within this strict limit, prioritizing conciseness in the main body to allocate sufficient space for timestamps and hashtags. Enrich the SRT basis extensively with contextual information and a high volume of relevant keywords derived from or related to the SRT.\nUnderstanding the Topic: Infer the main subject/theme deeply from the SRT. Identify specific entities accurately mentioned in the SRT. Use this understanding to target a broad range of relevant search queries.\nFormatting: Use reader-friendly paragraphs. Avoid numbered lists for main content. Structure for readability despite the length.\nOpening: Start with 2\u20134 compelling sentences summarizing the core value/hook from the SRT, front-loading crucial keywords.\nDetailed Elaboration / Main Body:\nThe main body of the description (before the timestamps) MUST BE AGGRESSIVELY AND UNCOMPROMISINGLY CONDENSED. Your task is to provide maximum information density with the absolute minimum words necessary, synthesizing the core arguments, pivotal events, key evidence, and significant implications from the SRT. Focus only on why events or theories are important, not just what happened, and avoid any non-essential descriptive language. Brevity is paramount in this section.\nFor each theme, extract core points from the SRT, then synthesize highly relevant external details, context, and key implications directly and concisely. Avoid lengthy elaborations; every word must add critical value or SEO weight.\nQuote impactful statements from the SRT transcript when appropriate, but focus primarily on original elaboration.\nIf discussing specific media mentioned or clearly implied in the SRT, use official titles and incorporate a wide array of related SEO keywords (actors, directors, studios, genre specifics, plot points, fan theories, critical reception, related works).\nWeave a rich, dense, and diverse array of highly relevant keywords naturally throughout \u2013 include long-tail keywords, semantic variations, question-based keywords, and terms reflecting various facets of viewer search intent related to the SRT topic. Prioritize the most impactful keywords and contextual information, using efficient and direct language to maximize keyword density within the condensed format. Focus on impactful, concise repetition of key concepts where space allows.\nTimestamps Section:\nIdentify key segments within the SRT data corresponding to major, macro-level topic shifts, distinct historical periods, or pivotal conceptual shifts. The goal is a highly curated list that clearly outlines the primary narrative progression of the video.\nAutomatic Video Length Inference: You MUST automatically determine the total video duration by identifying the LAST TIMESTAMP in the provided SRT content. This last timestamp (e.g., HH:MM:SS,ms or MM:SS,ms) represents the video's end time. Convert this end time to the total duration in minutes.\nStrict Timestamp Count Requirement: Based on the inferred total video duration (in minutes), you MUST calculate and adhere to a target of 3\u20134 timestamps per 10 minutes of video length.\n0\u201310 minutes \u2192 1\u20134 timestamps\n10\u201320 minutes \u2192 3\u20138 timestamps\n20\u201330 minutes \u2192 6\u201312 timestamps\nand so on.\n\n\nYou MUST ensure the number of generated timestamps falls within this calculated range.\nPrioritize fewer, more impactful timestamps that represent distinct, jumpable sections rather than minor sub-points, while still meeting the calculated count.\nEach timestamp description must be a concise, keyword-rich phrase (acting as a chapter title) that clearly indicates a major topic shift. It should be a brief, impactful phrase or short clause \u2013 not a full sentence \u2013 prioritizing clarity and keyword relevance for quick navigation. Use MM:SS \u2013 Descriptive Keyword Title. Ensure the MM:SS reflects the actual time in minutes and seconds within the video, using approximate start times from the SRT.\nClosing: Conclude with a clear Call to Action by encouraging likes, subscriptions, shares, comments, and notification bell clicks. Reinforce the video's value using keywords related to the SRT topic.\nIMPORTANT:\nDo not include section titles in the description.\nDo not use lists in the description section. All lists must be converted into proper text.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Hashtags\nGenerate exactly 3 strategically chosen hashtags relevant to the SRT content.\nMix broad, specific, and potentially trending terms.

    "Translate SRT": {
        "prompt": "translate to this target language: Chinese (simplified)\n\nMaintain correct SRT timestamp and numberings, but you can move words around in the same sentence.\n\nAct as an expert linguist, professional translator, and editor.\nYour task is to translate the provided source text into thetarget language. The target audience for your translation is educated readers, specifically those interested in academic and historical subjects. Your ultimate goal is to produce a translation that is not only perfectly accurate but also reads as if it were originally written by a native academic or historian writing in the target language, while retaining the sophisticated tone typical of the original source's academic discourse. The final text must be fluent, natural, and completely avoid the stiff, literal, or \"translation-ese\" feel. As a professional delivering the final, polished product, your output will consist solely of the translation itself.\nTo achieve this, you must follow this specific four-phase methodology:\n1. Deconstruct for Meaning (Phase 1: Understanding):\nBefore translating, first analyze each sentence and paragraph of the source text to fully grasp the author's core message, intent, and nuance. Prioritize the idea being conveyed over the literal words and sentence structure of the source text.\n2. Reconstruct Natively (Phase 2: Writing):\nDo not translate word-for-word. Instead, take the core idea you have understood from the source text and express it from scratch using natural, idiomatic target language.\nRestructure Sentences Freely: Feel free to break long, complex sentences from the source text into two or more shorter, clearer sentences in the target language. Conversely, you may combine short, choppy sentences from the source text into a single, more fluid sentence in the target language using appropriate conjunctions.\nPrioritize Target Language Grammar Flow: Actively change sentence structures (e.g., from passive to active voice, or vice versa if more natural in the target language) if it makes the sentence sound more natural and dynamic in the target language.\n3. Refine for Tone and Polish (Phase 3: Editing):\nChoose Sophisticated Diction: Select vocabulary that is precise, sophisticated, and appropriate for a formal, academic, and historical register in the target language.\nEnsure Rhythm and Cadence: The final translation must flow smoothly. Read it back (metaphorically) to catch any awkward phrasing or unnatural rhythms. Ensure a professional and authoritative tone throughout.\n4. Formatting Directives (Phase 4: Final Output Formatting):\nThe final translation must be delivered with the following specific Markdown formatting. These formatting rules are a non-negotiable part of the final output definition.\nOverall Structure: The entire response must be enclosed within a single Markdown code block (using triple backticks ```).\nHeadings: If the source text contains clear thematic sections or chapters, use a Level 2 Heading (##) for each section title.\nEmphasis: Use bold formatting (**text**) for key terms, names, or dates that are central to the historical argument being made. Use this sparingly for maximum impact.\nForeign Words: Use italic formatting (*text*) for any non-English words (e.g., Latin, French, German) that are intentionally retained in the English translation for academic accuracy (e.g., status quo, raison d'\u00e9tat).\nDirect Quotations: If the text includes a direct quotation from a historical source, format it as a Markdown blockquote (> text).\nLists: If the source text presents information in a list format, replicate it using a bulleted list (- Item 1).\nKey Constraints - What to AVOID at all costs:\nAVOID: Direct, literal translations that mirror source language sentence structure.\nAVOID: Awkward grammatical constructions or phrasing that, while possibly literal translations from the source language, sound unnatural or clunky in the target language.\nAVOID: Clumsy loan-word translations or terminology that is not standard in target language academic writing.\nSTRICT OUTPUT CONSTRAINT: Your response must contain NOTHING more and NOTHING less than the final translated text in the target language, formatted according to the directives above.\nSTRICT OUTPUT CONSTRAINT: Do NOT include any introductory phrases, concluding remarks, commentary, explanations of your process, conversational filler, or any other text before or after the translation. The ONLY acceptable output is the translation itself.\n[One-Shot Example]\nTo show you exactly what I mean by the desired translation and the strict output format, here is an example.\nOriginal Source Text (Indonesian): \"Hal lain yang menonjol dari kasus Indonesia adalah betapa harmonisnya permulaan hubungan Jepang-Indonesia. Hal ini tidak lain karena sambutan hangat yang diberikan oleh hampir seluruh rakyat Indonesia terhadap kedatangan tentara Jepang.\"\nGOOD (Ideal & Correct Output Format) Translation (English):\ncode Code\ndownloadcontent_copy\nexpand_less\n   Another remarkable feature of the Indonesian case was the harmonious start given to Japanese-Indonesian relations by the almost universal Indonesian welcome to the invaders.\n \nNow, applying all of the above principles, including the strict output constraints, please translate the following text, maintaining consistent format:",

Ignore the original line breaks from the image. Combine lines of text to form complete, flowing paragraphs.\nJoin Hyphenated Words: If a word is split with a hyphen at the end of a line, reconstruct it into a single word.\nIdentify True Paragraph Breaks: Apply paragraph breaks only where they exist in the original text, typically indicated by indentation or significant vertical spacing between text blocks.\nDetailed Markdown Formatting Instructions:\nYou must scan the source text for the following structural and stylistic elements and apply the corresponding Markdown syntax.\nHeadings:\nIdentify the main title of the document and format it as a Heading 1 (#).\nIdentify major section titles and format them as a Heading 2 (##).\nIdentify subsection titles and format them as a Heading 3 (###). Use your judgment for deeper-level headings (####).\n\n\nEmphasis:\nFor text that is italicized in the source, use single asterisks: *text*.\nFor text that is bold in the source, use double asterisks: **text**.\nFor text that is both bold and italicized, use triple asterisks: ***text***.\n\n\nLists:\nUnordered Lists: If you find a bulleted list (using symbols like \u2022, -, or *), transcribe it as a Markdown unordered list using hyphens (-).\nOrdered Lists: If you find a numbered list (e.g., 1., 2., a., b.), transcribe it as a Markdown ordered list (1., 2., 3.).\nNested Lists: Pay close attention to indentation to correctly represent nested list items.\n\n\nBlockquotes:\nIf a section of text is indented or visually set apart as a quotation, format it as a blockquote by prefixing each line with > .\n\n\nHorizontal Rules:\nIf the original document uses a distinct line or a series of characters (like *** or ---) to visually separate sections of text, represent this with a Markdown horizontal rule (---).\n\n\nStrikethrough:\nFor any text that has a line through it, use tildes to format it as strikethrough: ~~text~~.\n\n\nContent Cleanup Rules:\nExclude Extraneous Elements: Strictly omit page numbers, headers, footers, and any handwritten or printed marginalia.\nCorrect Obvious Errors: Silently fix any clear spelling or grammatical errors found in the source text.\nFinal Output Requirements:\nThe output must be only the transcribed text formatted in pure Markdown.\nDo not include any introductory phrases, explanations, or commentary in your response.
