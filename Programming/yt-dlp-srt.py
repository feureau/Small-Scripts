yt-dlp-srt.py
-----------------------------------

PURPOSE:
A robust wrapper script for the command-line tool 'yt-dlp'. Its primary function
is to efficiently download subtitles in SRT format for every video within a given
YouTube playlist (or for a single video). It is optimized for handling very large
playlists by processing downloads in parallel.

KEY FEATURES:
- Playlist Parsing: Intelligently fetches a list of all video IDs from a
  playlist URL without downloading any video data first.
- Parallel Downloads: Utilizes a thread pool to download multiple subtitle files
  concurrently, dramatically speeding up the process for large playlists.
- Clean & Sequential Logging: Prints progress to the console in a clean,
  scrolling format. Each task's start and end status is printed on its own
  line without messy, overlapping text from other threads.
- Robust Shutdown: Implements a powerful signal handler for Ctrl-C
  (KeyboardInterrupt). When pressed, it immediately terminates all running
  yt-dlp subprocesses, cancels all pending downloads, and forces the script
  to exit cleanly, preventing it from hanging or leaving orphaned processes.
- User Configuration: Key settings like the path to yt-dlp and the number of
  parallel workers can be easily changed in the configuration section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HISTORY OF CHOICES / DESIGN EVOLUTION:
This script has undergone several revisions, with each change addressing problems
discovered in the previous version. Understanding this evolution explains why the
script is designed the way it is today.

1. INITIAL APPROACH: THE SINGLE COMMAND PROBLEM
   - The first idea was to simply wrap a single yt-dlp command with the right flags.
   - PROBLEM: yt-dlp processes an entire playlist as a single job. This offered
     poor control. If one subtitle failed, it could complicate the entire batch.
     It also made implementing custom progress logging difficult.

2. GRANULAR CONTROL: PER-VIDEO PROCESSING
   - DECISION: The script was changed to first fetch a list of all video IDs
     in the playlist using `yt-dlp --flat-playlist --dump-json`.
   - JUSTIFICATION: This pivotal change allowed the script to iterate through
     the videos and launch a separate, dedicated `yt-dlp` process for each one.
     This provides granular control, better error handling (one failure doesn't
     stop everything), and enables custom progress tracking (e.g., "[5/1998]").

3. PERFORMANCE: ADDING PARALLELISM
   - DECISION: To handle large playlists efficiently, Python's
     `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` was introduced.
   - JUSTIFICATION: This allows multiple `yt-dlp` subprocesses to run at the
     same time, limited by the `PARALLEL_DOWNLOADS` variable. This turns a slow,
     sequential process into a much faster, parallel one.

4. THE CONSOLE OUTPUT CHALLENGE: A Multi-Stage Evolution
   - PROBLEM: With multiple threads printing to the console simultaneously, the
     output became a jumbled, overlapping, and unreadable mess.
   - ATTEMPT 1 (FAILED): A dynamic, full-screen display was created using ANSI
     escape codes to clear the screen and redraw the status of N workers in fixed
     positions.
     - WHY IT FAILED: This was overly complex, caused flickering, and behaved
       inconsistently across different operating systems and terminal emulators.
   - ATTEMPT 2 (FAILED): A simpler approach using the carriage return `\r` to
     overwrite a single line in-place was tried.
     - WHY IT FAILED: This also proved unreliable. When the console scrolled,
       threads would fight to update the same line, resulting in garbled text.
       The `]]]]]]]` progress bar artifacts from yt-dlp also interfered with it.
   - FINAL SOLUTION (ROBUST AND SIMPLE): All complex cursor manipulation was
     abandoned. The current design uses a simple `threading.Lock` around every
     `print()` call.
     - JUSTIFICATION: This is the most reliable solution. While it doesn't offer
       fancy in-place updates, it guarantees that every line printed to the
       console is a complete, atomic message. This results in a clean, universally
       compatible scrolling log that is easy to read and impossible to corrupt.
       The `]]]]]]` artifacts were also removed by adding the `--no-progress`
       flag to the yt-dlp command.

5. THE GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN CHALLENGE
   - PROBLEM: Simply catching `KeyboardInterrupt` was not enough. The main thread
     would exit, but the `ThreadPoolExecutor` and the child `yt-dlp.exe` processes
     would continue running in the background, leaving the script "stuck".
   - FINAL SOLUTION (FORCEFUL AND CLEAN): A custom `signal_handler` for SIGINT
     (the signal sent by Ctrl-C) was implemented.
     - JUSTIFICATION: This handler does three things to guarantee a clean exit:
       1. It terminates all known running `yt-dlp` subprocesses directly.
       2. It calls `executor.shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)` to
          immediately cancel all queued tasks in the thread pool.
       3. It calls `os._exit(1)` for an immediate, non-negotiable termination of
          the Python script itself. This is a deliberate choice to prevent the
          script from hanging while waiting for threads that might not close
          cleanly, ensuring the user regains control of their terminal instantly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER-CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES:
 - YTDLP_PATH: The path to your yt-dlp executable. If it's in your system's
   PATH, "yt-dlp" is sufficient. Otherwise, use a full path.
 - OUTPUT_TEMPLATE: The filename pattern for the downloaded SRT files. The
   default saves them to the current directory with the video's title.
 - PARALLEL_DOWNLOADS: The number of videos to download at the same time. A
   good default is 6, but this can be tuned based on your network and CPU.
