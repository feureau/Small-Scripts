A powerful and user-friendly command-line utility for bulk renaming files within
a directory tree. This script searches for files based on a pattern and replaces
a specified part of their names with a new string.

It is designed to be safe and intuitive, featuring a recursive-by-default search
and an interactive confirmation step to prevent accidental changes.

--         FEATURES          --
---------------------------------

*   RECURSIVE BY DEFAULT: Automatically searches the current directory and all of
    its subdirectories for matching files. No special flags are needed for this,
    making it fast and easy to use.

*   INTERACTIVE CONFIRMATION: Displays a full list of all proposed changes and
    waits for the user's explicit 'y' confirmation before renaming any files.
    This is a critical safety feature to prevent mistakes.

*   FLEXIBLE PATTERN MATCHING: Intelligently handles command-line arguments,
    allowing the use of unquoted wildcards (like *.txt) in most shells.

*   STRING REMOVAL: To remove a piece of a filename, simply provide an empty
    string ("") as the replacement string.

*   SHALLOW SEARCH OPTION: For cases where you only want to search the current
    directory (and not subdirectories), a special flag (`-s`) is available.

*   CROSS-PLATFORM: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

--           USAGE           --
---------------------------------

The script is called from the command line with the following structure:

python filerename.py [file_pattern] [old_string] [new_string] [options]

--- ARGUMENTS ---

1.  [file_pattern]:
    The pattern to match files against. The shell's wildcard expansion is
    supported. For simple cases, quotes are not needed.
    Examples: *.txt, request-*.log, image_?.jpg

2.  [old_string]:
    The exact string within the filenames that you want to replace. If the
    string contains spaces, enclose it in quotes.

3.  [new_string]:
    The string that will replace [old_string]. To delete [old_string]
    entirely, use a pair of empty quotes (""). If the string contains spaces,
    enclose it in quotes.

--- OPTIONS ---

  -s, --shallow
    Disables the default recursive behavior and performs a "shallow" search,
    meaning it will ONLY look for files in the current working directory.

  -h, --help
    Displays this help message and exits.

---------------------------------
--          EXAMPLES         --
---------------------------------

(Assume you have opened a terminal in your project's root folder)

1. BASIC RECURSIVE RENAME:
   Rename all '.log' files in the current folder AND all subfolders by changing
   "backup" to "archived".

   > python filerename.py *.log "backup" "archived"

2. REMOVING A STRING (DELETION):
   Recursively find all '.txt' files and remove the suffix "_draft" from their
   names. This is the most common use case for the empty "" string.

   > python filerename.py *.txt "_draft" ""

3. SHALLOW SEARCH (NON-RECURSIVE):
   Rename files ONLY in the current directory. Do not touch any subfolders.
   Here, we change "temp_" to "final_" in all 'data-*.csv' files.

   > python filerename.py data-*.csv "temp_" "final_" -s

4. FILENAMES WITH SPACES:
   Recursively rename files, replacing "Final Report" with "Official Document".
   Quotes are necessary because of the spaces.

   > python filerename.py *.docx "Final Report" "Official Document"

---------------------------------
--     INSTALLATION & SETUP    --
---------------------------------

1.  Requires Python 3.
2.  Save this script as `filerename.py`.
3.  To run it from any directory, you can either:
    a) Call it with its full path: `python C:\\path\\to\\scripts\\filerename.py ...`
    b) [RECOMMENDED] Add the folder containing `filerename.py` to your system's
       PATH environment variable. After doing this, you can simply type
       `filerename.py ...` from any folder.
