sanitize_filenames.py

Place this script in a folder (e.g. "scripts/") and invoke it from any directory.
It will expand glob patterns you pass, sanitize filenames to include only letters, numbers, and spaces,
and then either rename files in-place or copy them into a specified output directory.

Usage:
  # Rename files in-place (default):
  python sanitize_filenames.py "*.txt" "data/*.csv"

  # Dry-run to see changes without modifying files:
  python sanitize_filenames.py -d "*.txt" "data/*.csv"

  # Copy sanitized files into a folder:
  python sanitize_filenames.py -o clean_files "*.txt" "data/*.csv"

  # Dry-run copy:
  python sanitize_filenames.py -d -o clean_files "*.txt" "data/*.csv"

  # Process files recursively:
  python sanitize_filenames.py "photos/**/*.jpg"

  # Help:
  python sanitize_filenames.py -h
